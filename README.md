# Super-Store-Analysis
In this Power BI project, I have created four different pages: Home, Sales Analysis, Profit Analysis, and Category Analysis.
On the Home page, I have added all the necessary information so that someone who wants more detailed information about sales, profit, or category can land on that page using the page navigator.
In this project, I have added a "Clear All Filters" button using a bookmark. Clicking this button removes all the filters at once. I added this button because there are many slicers in this project, and it makes it easier for users who are not familiar with Power BI.
